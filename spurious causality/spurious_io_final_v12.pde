/*
  *This code turns an arduino mega into an I/O serial board. This version is quick and dirty, and formatted terribly.
  The first thing
  anyone should do is change the variables and loop values to reflect the number of pins actually used.
  This version is hard coded to use pins 22-53 for input and 0-16 for output (reserving 13 for the arduino test LED.)
  Analog reads could be added pretty easily. 
  Don't forget to pull-down to ground each digital input pin through a 10 to 100K ohm resistor, or readings will be shaky. 
  The following cod sends single byte commands/readings to and from another serial device. 
  The highest two bits of each byte are the command type flags, and the following 6 are payload 
  (an analog value with 64 point resolution or, in the case of digital operations, a pin number 0-63 )
  This protocol supports 64 digital inputs, 64 digital outputs, 2 Analog readings, and 2 PWM outputs (with 64 point resolution).
  10xxxxxx = digital pin set LOW  (do a bitwise 'or' 128)
  11xxxxxx = digital pin set HIGH (bitwise 192)
  00xxxxxx = Analog value device 0  (bitwise 0)
  01xxxxxx = Analog value device 1 (bitwise 64)
  So as you see, a limitation of this single byte encoding is you only get 2 analog devices. 
  *The readPins loop sends readings from digital and analog input pins to another device over serial. It only sends values for pins whos state has changed.
  *The setPins loop takes incoming serial bytes and sets pins accordingly
  You'll see a lot of bit operations doing "value & 63" , since 192 is 00111111 and will clear out the highest two bits, leaving just the payload.
